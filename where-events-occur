WHERE EVENTS OCCUR
The event object can tell you where the cursor was positioned when an event was triggered. 
The three different positions that can be retrieved when the mouse moves or is clicked.
Client X/Y – indicates the position of cursor within the browser
Page X/Y – indicates the position of cursor within the page
Screen X/Y – indicates the position of the cursor with in the screen
The positions are all properties of an EVENT OBJECT so to access them pass event as a parameter in a function. Eg. function showPosition(event) {}
