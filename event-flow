EVENT  FLOW
The order in which events fire and they fire in two directions.
EVENT BUBBLING 
â€“ Event starts at most specific node and flows outwards to least specific node.  (default for browsers)
EVENT CAPTURING 
-  Event starts at least specific node and flows inwards to most specific node. 
Flow of events matter when you have an event handler on an element and its ancestor/descendant. 
Browsers default to using bubbling when using:
1.	DOM event handler or 2. HTML event attributes
addEventListener all the choice of direction to trigger events
1.	True: capturing
2.	False:  bubbling
