EVENT  FLOW
The order in which events fire and they fire in two directions.
EVENT BUBBLING 
– Event starts at most specific node and flows outwards to least specific node.  (default for browsers)
EVENT CAPTURING 
-  Event starts at least specific node and flows inwards to most specific node. 
Flow of events matter when you have an event handler on an element and its ancestor/descendant. 
Browsers default to using bubbling when using:
1.	DOM event handler or 2. HTML event attributes
addEventListener all the choice of direction to trigger events
1.	True: capturing
2.	False:  bubbling




Creating event listeners for a lot of elements can use memory and slows down the page. 
Event flow allows you to listen for an event on a parent. 
Event Flow allows events to affect the containing element (parent).
Place event handlers on containing elements and use the EVENT OBJECT’s target property to find which children the event happened on.

Placing only one eventlistener on the <u1> element rather than on each <li> element. 
It gives better performance and allows the removal/addition of items from the list and not affecting how it works.
